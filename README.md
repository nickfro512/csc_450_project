# csc_450_project

This is a project for CSC 450 - Senior Research at Eastern Connecticut State University. It involved using a neural network to try and predict whether or not a given genetic sample is from somebody with Alzheimer's.

Notes on CSV files:

expression_testing - First set of testing samples used
expression_testing 2 - Second set of testing samples (MCI status samples dropped)
expression_testing_2_skew - MCI dropped, smaller number of samples (more in the matching training set)

expression_training - First set of testing samples used
expression_training 2 - Second set of testing samples (MCI status samples dropped)
expression_training_2_skew - MCI dropped, larger number of samples (less in the matching training set)

full_expression_new_drop - full set of samples and their statuses with MCI status samples dropped - other files with 2 in the name were derived from this
